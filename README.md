Hi, I’m **Nikos** 👋

I build tools that make **Unreal Engine** projects feel smaller: faster understanding, safer refactors, and instant documentation-without the busywork.

## 🚀 Featured — **Context Nexus**
**Seed → Minimal DSL → Fast Answers → Zero friction.**  
_Context Nexus_ is an AI-powered copilot for **Unreal Engine 5** that understands **C++ and Blueprints together** so you can navigate, debug, and document real production projects in seconds.

- **Three run modes** for the one‑shot parser: **UltraFast**, **Fast**, **Semantic**
- **No SharedPCH required** — stable one‑shot parsing with a tiny virtual‑PCH header set
- **Unified explorer** across C++/BP with Unreal‑specific linting
- **One‑click documentation** that produces clean, cross‑linked Markdown

> Repos are private while in active development. I’m onboarding a small set of partners for early access — feel free to reach out.

## 🧩 What I work on
- **Developer tooling** for large, hybrid Unreal codebases (C++ + Blueprint)
- **Context packing** (send only the surgical slice an LLM needs)
- **Static analysis for UE** (replication, perf, footguns)
- **“Invisible until needed” UX** inside the editor

---

## 📍 Roadmap (high‑level)
- **M1** — Always‑on indexer & status LED (delta parsing)  
- **M2** — Unified explorer (filters, cross‑refs, quick actions)  
- **M3** — Context packing v1 (intent → targets → slices)  
- **M5** — Linter v1 (UE‑specific checks, inline surfacing)  
- **M6** — One‑click docs (per‑asset & project)  
- **M7** — Collaboration (shareable “Context Bundles”)
